    For this data processing pipeline, reading node files is not needed. All the needed information about
    the nodes can be found in the metadata json file. This function generates the nodes owned by a given
    process, using metis partitions.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    rank : int
        rank of the process
    world_size : int
        total no. of processes
    num_parts : int
        total no. of partitions
    id_lookup : instance of class DistLookupService
       Distributed lookup service used to map global-nids to respective partition-ids and
       shuffle-global-nids
    ntid_ntype_map :
        a dictionary where keys are node_type ids(integers) and values are node_type names(strings).
    schema_map:
        dictionary formed by reading the input metadata json file for the input dataset.

        Please note that, it is assumed that for the input graph files, the nodes of a particular node-type are
        split into `p` files (because of `p` partitions to be generated). On a similar node, edges of a particular
        edge-type are split into `p` files as well.

        #assuming m nodetypes present in the input graph
        "num_nodes_per_chunk" : [
            [a0, a1, a2, ... a<p-1>],
            [b0, b1, b2, ... b<p-1>],
            ...
            [m0, m1, m2, ... m<p-1>]
        ]
        Here, each sub-list, corresponding a nodetype in the input graph, has `p` elements. For instance [a0, a1, ... a<p-1>]
        where each element represents the number of nodes which are to be processed by a process during distributed partitioning.

        In addition to the above key-value pair for the nodes in the graph, the node-features are captured in the
        "node_data" key-value pair. In this dictionary the keys will be nodetype names and value will be a dictionary which
        is used to capture all the features present for that particular node-type. This is shown in the following example:

        "node_data" : {
            "paper": {       # node type
                "feat": {   # feature key
                    "format": {"name": "numpy"},
                    "data": ["node_data/paper-feat-part1.npy", "node_data/paper-feat-part2.npy"]
                },
                "label": {   # feature key
                    "format": {"name": "numpy"},
                    "data": ["node_data/paper-label-part1.npy", "node_data/paper-label-part2.npy"]
                },
                "year": {   # feature key
                    "format": {"name": "numpy"},
                    "data": ["node_data/paper-year-part1.npy", "node_data/paper-year-part2.npy"]
                }
            }
        }
        In the above textual description we have a node-type, which is paper, and it has 3 features namely feat, label and year.
        Each feature has `p` files whose location in the filesystem is the list for the key "data" and "foramt" is used to
        describe storage format.

    Returns:
    --------
    dictionary :
        dictionary where keys are column names and values are numpy arrays, these arrays are generated by
        using information present in the metadata json file

    This function is used to shuffle node features so that each process will receive
    all the node features whose corresponding nodes are owned by the same process.
    The mapping procedure to identify the owner process is not straight forward. The
    following steps are used to identify the owner processes for the locally read node-
    features.
    a. Compute the global_nids for the locally read node features. Here metadata json file
        is used to identify the corresponding global_nids. Please note that initial graph input
        nodes.txt files are sorted based on node_types.
    b. Using global_nids and metis partitions owner processes can be easily identified.
    c. Now each process sends the global_nids for which shuffle_global_nids are needed to be
        retrieved.
    d. After receiving the corresponding shuffle_global_nids these ids are added to the
        node_data and edge_data dictionaries

    are maintained as tensors throughout the various stages of the pipeline execution.

       (wherer `p` is no. of partitions).
    b) Similarly edge metadata contains information about edges which are split into p-files.
    c) Node and Edge features, it is also assumed that each node (and edge) feature, if present, is also
       split into `p` files.

    For example, a sample metadata json file might be as follows: :
    (In this toy example, we assume that we have "m" node-types, "k" edge types, and for node_type = ntype0-name
     we have two features namely feat0-name and feat1-name. Please note that the node-features are also split into
     `p` files. This will help in load-balancing during data-shuffling phase).

    Terminology used to identify any particular "id" assigned to nodes, edges or node features. Prefix "global" is
    used to indicate that this information is either read from the input dataset or autogenerated based on the information
    read from input dataset files. Prefix "type" is used to indicate a unique id assigned to either nodes or edges.
    For instance, type_node_id means that a unique id, with a given node type,  assigned to a node. And prefix "shuffle"
    will be used to indicate a unique id, across entire graph, assigned to either a node or an edge. For instance,
    SHUFFLE_GLOBAL_NID means a unique id which is assigned to a node after the data shuffle is completed.

    Some high-level notes on the structure of the metadata json file.
    1. path(s) mentioned in the entries for nodes, edges and node-features files can be either absolute or relative.
       if these paths are relative, then it is assumed that they are relative to the folder from which the execution is
       launched.
    2. The id_startx and id_endx represent the type_node_id and type_edge_id respectively for nodes and edge data. This
       means that these ids should match the no. of nodes/edges read from any given file. Since these are type_ids for
       the nodes and edges in any given file, their global_ids can be easily computed as well.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Reads the metis partitions to identify the owner process of all the nodes in the entire graph.
    2. Reads the input data set, each partitipating process will map to a single file for the edges,
        node-features and edge-features for each node-type and edge-types respectively. Using nodes metadata
        information, nodes which are owned by a given process are generated to optimize communication to some
        extent.
    3. Now each process shuffles the data by identifying the respective owner processes using metis
        partitions.
        a. To identify owner processes for nodes, metis partitions will be used.
        b. For edges, the owner process of the destination node will be the owner of the edge as well.
        c. For node and edge features, identifying the owner process is a little bit involved.
            For this purpose, graph metadata json file is used to first map the locally read node features
            to their global_nids. Now owner process is identified using metis partitions for these global_nids
            to retrieve shuffle_global_nids. A similar process is used for edge_features as well.
        d. After all the data shuffling is done, the order of node-features may be different when compared to
            their global_type_nids. Node- and edge-data are ordered by node-type and edge-type respectively.
            And now node features and edge features are re-ordered to match the order of their node- and edge-types.
    4. Last step is to create the DGL objects with the data present on each of the processes.
        a. DGL objects for nodes, edges, node- and edge- features.
        b. Metadata is gathered from each process to create the global metadata json file, by process rank = 0.
