7.1 Data Preprocessing
------------------------------------------

Before launching training jobs, DGL requires the input data to be partitioned
and distributed to the target machines. In order to handle different scales
of graphs, DGL provides 2 partitioning approaches:

* A partitioning API for graphs that can fit in a single machine memory.
* A distributed partition pipeline for graphs beyond a single machine capacity.

7.1.1 Partitioning API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For relatively small graphs, DGL provides a partitioning API
:func:`~dgl.distributed.partition_graph` that partitions
an in-memory :class:`~dgl.DGLGraph` object. It supports
multiple partitioning algorithms such as random partitioning and
`Metis <http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis>`__.
The benefit of Metis partitioning is that it can generate partitions with
minimal edge cuts to reduce network communication for distributed training and
inference. DGL uses the latest version of Metis with the options optimized for
the real-world graphs with power-law distribution. After partitioning, the API
constructs the partitioned results in a format that is easy to load during the
training. For example,

.. code-block:: python

    import dgl

    g = ...  # create or load a DGLGraph object
    dgl.distributed.partition_graph(g, 'mygraph', 2, 'data_root_dir')

will outputs the following data file.

.. code-block:: none

    data_root_dir/
      |-- mygraph.json          # metadata JSON. File name is the given graph name.
      |-- part0/                # data for partition 0
      |  |-- node_feats.dgl     # node features stored in binary format
      |  |-- edge_feats.dgl     # edge features stored in binary format
      |  |-- graph.dgl          # graph structure of this partition stored in binary format
      |
      |-- part1/                # data for partition 1
         |-- node_feats.dgl
         |-- edge_feats.dgl
         |-- graph.dgl

Chapter :ref:`guide-distributed-partition` covers more details about the
partition format. To distribute the partitions to a cluster, users can either save
the data in some shared folder accessible by all machines, or copy the metadata
JSON as well as the corresponding partition folder ``partX`` to the X^th machine.

Using :func:`~dgl.distributed.partition_graph` requires an instance with large enough
CPU RAM to hold the entire graph structure and features, which may not be viable for
graphs with hundreds of billions of edges or large features. We describe how to use
the *parallel data preparation pipeline* for such cases next.

Load balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When partitioning a graph, by default, METIS only balances the number of nodes
in each partition.  This can result in suboptimal configuration, depending on
the task at hand. For example, in the case of semi-supervised node
classification, a trainer performs computation on a subset of labeled nodes in
a local partition. A partitioning that only balances nodes in a graph (both
labeled and unlabeled), may end up with computational load imbalance. To get a
balanced workload in each partition, the partition API allows balancing between
partitions with respect to the number of nodes in each node type, by specifying
``balance_ntypes`` in :func:`~dgl.distributed.partition_graph`. Users can take
advantage of this and consider nodes in the training set, validation set and
test set are of different node types.

The following example considers nodes inside the training set and outside the
training set are two types of nodes:

.. code:: python

    dgl.distributed.partition_graph(g, 'graph_name', 4, '/tmp/test', balance_ntypes=g.ndata['train_mask'])

In addition to balancing the node types,
:func:`dgl.distributed.partition_graph` also allows balancing between
in-degrees of nodes of different node types by specifying ``balance_edges``.
This balances the number of edges incident to the nodes of different types.

ID mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After partitioning, :func:`~dgl.distributed.partition_graph` remap node
and edge IDs so that nodes of the same partition are aranged together
(in a consecutive ID range), making it easier to store partitioned node/edge
features. The API also automatically shuffles the node/edge features
according to the new IDs. However, some downstream tasks may want to
recover the original node/edge IDs (such as extracting the computed node
embeddings for later use). For such cases, pass ``return_mapping=True``
to :func:`~dgl.distributed.partition_graph`, which makes the API returns
the ID mappings between the remapped node/edge IDs and their origianl ones.
For a homogeneous graph, it returns two vectors. The first vector maps every new
node ID to its original ID; the second vector maps every new edge ID to
its original ID. For a heterogeneous graph, it returns two dictionaries of
vectors. The first dictionary contains the mapping for each node type; the
second dictionary contains the mapping for each edge type.

.. code:: python

    node_map, edge_map = dgl.distributed.partition_graph(g, 'graph_name', 4, '/tmp/test',
                                                         balance_ntypes=g.ndata['train_mask'],
                                                         return_mapping=True)
    # Let's assume that node_emb is saved from the distributed training.
    orig_node_emb = th.zeros(node_emb.shape, dtype=node_emb.dtype)
    orig_node_emb[node_map] = node_emb


Load partitioned graphs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DGL provides a :func:`dgl.distributed.load_partition` function to load one partition
for inspection.

.. code:: python

  >>> import dgl
  >>> # load partition 0
  >>> part_data = dgl.distributed.load_partition('data_root_dir/graph_name.json', 0)
  >>> g, nfeat, efeat, partition_book, graph_name, ntypes, etypes = part_data  # unpack
  >>> print(g)
  Graph(num_nodes=966043, num_edges=34270118,
        ndata_schemes={'orig_id': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64),
                       'part_id': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64),
                       '_ID': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64),
                       'inner_node': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int32)}
        edata_schemes={'_ID': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64),
                       'inner_edge': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int8),
                       'orig_id': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64)})

As mentioned in the `ID mapping`_ section, each partition carries auxiliary information
saved as ndata or edata such as original node/edge IDs, partition IDs, etc. Each partition
not only saves nodes/edges it owns, but also includes node/edges that are adjacent to
the partition (called **HALO** nodes/edges). The ``inner_node`` and ``inner_edge``
indicate whether a node/edge truely belongs to the partition (value is ``True``)
or is a HALO node/edge (value is ``False``).

The :func:`~dgl.distributed.load_partition` function loads all data at once. Users can
load features or the partition book using the :func:`dgl.distributed.load_partition_feats`
and :func:`dgl.distributed.load_partition_book` APIs respectively.


7.1.2 Distributed Graph Partitioning Pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To handle massive graph data that cannot fit in the CPU RAM of a
single machine, DGL utilizes data chunking and parallel processing to reduce
memory footprint and running time. The figure below illustrates the
pipeline:

.. figure:: https://data.dgl.ai/asset/image/guide_7_distdataprep.png

* The pipeline takes input data stored in *Chunked Graph Format* and
  produces and dispatches data partitions to the target machines.
* **Step.1 Graph Partitioning:** It calculates the ownership of each partition
  and saves the results as a set of files called *partition assignment*.
  To speedup the step, some algorithms (e.g., ParMETIS) support parallel computing
  using multiple machines.
* **Step.2 Data Dispatching:** Given the partition assignment, the step then
  physically partitions the graph data and dispatches them to the machines user
  specified. It also converts the graph data into formats that are suitable for
  distributed training and evaluation.

The whole pipeline is modularized so that each step can be invoked
individually. For example, users can replace Step.1 with some custom graph partition
algorithm as long as it produces partition assignment files
correctly.

.. _guide-distributed-prep-chunk:
Chunked Graph Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the pipeline, DGL requires the input graph to be stored in multiple data
chunks.  Each data chunk is the unit of data preprocessing and thus should fit
into CPU RAM.  In this section, we use the MAG240M-LSC data from `Open Graph
Benchmark <https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/mag240m/>`__  as an example to
describe the overall design, followed by a formal specification and
tips for creating data in such format.

Example: MAG240M-LSC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MAG240M-LSC graph is a heterogeneous academic graph
extracted from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), whose schema diagram is
illustrated below:

.. figure:: https://data.dgl.ai/asset/image/guide_7_mag240m.png

Its raw data files are organized as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    /mydata/MAG240M-LSC/
      |-- meta.pt   # # A dictionary of the number of nodes for each type saved by torch.save,
      |             # as well as num_classes
      |-- processed/
        |-- author___affiliated_with___institution/
        |  |-- edge_index.npy            # graph, 713 MB
        |
        |-- paper/
        |  |-- node_feat.npy             # feature, 187 GB, (numpy memmap format)
        |  |-- node_label.npy            # label, 974 MB
        |  |-- node_year.npy             # year, 974 MB
        |
        |-- paper___cites___paper/
        |  |-- edge_index.npy            # graph, 21 GB
        |
        |-- author___writes___paper/
           |-- edge_index.npy            # graph, 6GB

The graph has three node types (``"paper"``, ``"author"`` and ``"institution"``),
three edge types/relations (``"cites"``, ``"writes"`` and ``"affiliated_with"``). The
``"paper"`` nodes have three attributes (``"feat"``, ``"label"``, ``"year"'``), while
other types of nodes and edges are featureless. Below shows the data files when
it is stored in DGL Chunked Graph Format:

.. code-block:: none

    /mydata/MAG240M-LSC_chunked/
      |-- metadata.json            # metadata json file
      |-- edges/                   # stores edge ID data
      |  |-- writes-part1.csv
      |  |-- writes-part2.csv
      |  |-- writes-part3.csv
      |  |-- affiliated_with-part1.csv
      |  |-- affiliated_with-part2.csv
      |  |-- cites-part1.csv
      |  |-- cites-part2.csv
      |  |-- cites-part3.csv
      |  |-- cites-part4.csv
      |
      |-- node_data/               # stores node feature data
         |-- paper-feat-part1.npy
         |-- paper-feat-part2.npy
         |-- paper-feat-part3.npy
         |-- paper-label-part1.npy
         |-- paper-label-part2.npy
         |-- paper-year-part1.npy
         |-- paper-year-part2.npy
         |-- paper-year-part3.npy
         |-- paper-year-part4.npy

All the data files are chunked into parts or chunks, including the edges of each relation
(e.g., writes, affiliates, cites) and node features. If the graph has edge features,
they will be chunked into multiple files too. All ID data are stored in
CSV (we will illustrate the contents soon) while node features are stored in
numpy arrays.

.. note::
    Please note that the files for edges (writes, affiliates, cites) are chunked 
    into multiple files. The no. of files for each edge type can be split into any
    number of files.

.. note::
    Data preprocessing pipeline only assumes that the files for edges and edge-features
    for any edge type are chunked into same number of files. For instance, in the 
    above example if the graph had edge features for ``cites`` then the edge feature
    files for ``cites`` edge type should also be chunked into 4 files.

The ``metadata.json`` stores all the metadata information such as file names
and chunk sizes (e.g., number of nodes, number of edges).

            }
       },
       "edge_data" : {}  # MAG240M-LSC does not have edge features
    }

There are three parts in ``metadata.json``:

* Graph schema information and chunk sizes, e.g., ``"node_type"`` , ``"num_nodes_per_type"``, etc.
* Edge index data under key ``"edges"``.
* Node/edge feature data under keys ``"node_data"`` and ``"edge_data"``.

The edge index files contain edges in the form of node ID pairs:

.. code-block:: bash

    # writes-part1.csv
    0 0
    0 1
    0 20
    0 29
    0 1203
    ...

Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, a chunked graph data folder just needs a ``metadata.json`` and a
bunch of data files. The folder structure in the MAG240M-LSC example is not a
strict requirement as long as ``metadata.json`` contains valid file paths.

``metadata.json`` top-level keys:

* ``graph_name``: String. Unique name used by :class:`dgl.distributed.DistGraph`
  to load graph.
* ``node_type``: List of string. Node type names.
* ``num_nodes_per_type``: List of integer. For graphs with :math:`T` node
  types the value contains a list :math:`T` integers.
  Each integer in this list specifies the number of nodes
  for a given node type.
* ``edge_type``: List of string. Edge type names in the form of
  ``<source node type>:<relation>:<destination node type>``.
* ``num_edges_per_type``: List of integer. For graphs with :math:`R` edge
  types, the value contains a list of :math:`R` integers.
  Each integer specifies the number of edges
  for a given edge type.
* ``edges``: Dict of ``ChunkFileSpec``. Edge index files.
  Dictionary keys are edge type names in the form of
  ``<source node type>:<relation>:<destination node type>``.
* ``node_data``: Dict of ``ChunkFileSpec``. Data files that store node attributes
  could have arbitrary number of files regardless of ``num_parts``. Dictionary
  keys are node type names.
* ``edge_data``: Dict of ``ChunkFileSpec``. Data files that store edge attributes
  could have arbitrary number of files regardless of ``num_parts``. Dictionary
  keys are edge type names in the form of
  ``<source node type>:<relation>:<destination node type>``.

``ChunkFileSpec`` has two keys:

* ``format``: File format. Depending on the format ``name``, users can configure more
  details about how to parse each data file.
    - ``"csv"``: CSV file. Use the ``delimiter`` key to specify delimiter in use.
    - ``"numpy"``: NumPy array binary file created by :func:`numpy.save`.
    - ``"parquet"``: parquet table binary file created by :func:`pyarrow.parquet.write_table`.
* ``data``: List of string. File path to each data chunk. Support absolute path.

Tips for making chunked graph data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the raw data, the implementation could include:

* Construct graphs out of non-structured data such as texts or tabular data.
* Augment or transform the input graph struture or features. E.g., adding reverse
  or self-loop edges, normalizing features, etc.
* Chunk the input graph structure and features into multiple data files so that
  each one can fit in CPU RAM for subsequent preprocessing steps.

To avoid running into out-of-memory error, it is recommended to process graph
structures and feature data separately. Processing one chunk at a time can also
reduce the maximal runtime memory footprint. As an example, DGL provides a
`tools/chunk_graph.py
<https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/blob/master/tools/chunk_graph.py>`_ script that
chunks an in-memory feature-less :class:`~dgl.DGLGraph` and feature tensors
stored in :class:`numpy.memmap`.


.. _guide-distributed-prep-partition:
Step.1 Graph Partitioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This step reads the chunked graph data and calculates which partition each node
should belong to. The results are saved in a set of *partition assignment files*.
For example, to randomly partition MAG240M-LSC to two parts, run the
``partition_algo/random_partition.py`` script in the ``tools`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    python /my/repo/dgl/tools/partition_algo/random_partition.py
        --in_dir /mydata/MAG240M-LSC_chunked
        --out_dir /mydata/MAG240M-LSC_2parts
        --num_partitions 2

, which outputs files as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    MAG240M-LSC_2parts/
      |-- paper.txt
      |-- author.txt
      |-- institution.txt

Each file stores the partition assignment of the corresponding node type.
The contents are the partition ID of each node stored in lines, i.e., line i is
the partition ID of node i.

.. code-block:: bash

    # paper.txt
    0
    1
    1
    0
    0
    1
    0
    ...

Despite its simplicity, random partitioning may result in frequent
cross-machine communication.  Check out chapter
:ref:`guide-distributed-partition` for more advanced options.

Step.2 Data Dispatching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DGL provides a ``dispatch_data.py`` script to physically partition the data and
dispatch partitions to each training machines. It will also convert the data
once again to data objects that can be loaded by DGL training processes
efficiently. The entire step can be further accelerated using multi-processing.

.. code-block:: bash

    python /myrepo/dgl/tools/dispatch_data.py         \
       --in-dir /mydata/MAG240M-LSC_chunked/          \
       --partitions-dir /mydata/MAG240M-LSC_2parts/   \
       --out-dir /mydata/MAG_LSC_partitioned            \
       --ip-config ip_config.txt

* ``--in-dir`` specifies the path to the folder of the input chunked graph data produced
* ``--partitions-dir`` specifies the path to the partition assignment folder produced by Step.1.
* ``--out-dir`` specifies the path to stored the data partition on each machine.
* ``--ip-config`` specifies the IP configuration file of the cluster.

An example IP configuration file is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    172.31.19.1
    172.31.23.205

As a counterpart of ``return_mapping=True`` in :func:`~dgl.distributed.partition_graph`, the
:ref:`distributed partitioning pipeline <guide-distributed-preprocessing>`
provides two arguments in ``dispatch_data.py`` to save the original node/edge IDs to disk.

* ``--save-orig-nids`` save original node IDs into files.
* ``--save-orig-eids`` save original edge IDs into files.

Specifying the two options will create two files ``orig_nids.dgl`` and ``orig_eids.dgl``
under each partition folder.

.. code-block:: none

    data_root_dir/
      |-- graph_name.json       # partition configuration file in JSON
      |-- part0/                # data for partition 0
      |  |-- orig_nids.dgl      # original node IDs
      |  |-- orig_eids.dgl      # original edge IDs

The two files store the original IDs as a dictionary of tensors, where keys are node/edge
type names and values are ID tensors. Users can use the :func:`dgl.data.load_tensors`
utility to load them:

.. code:: python

    # Load the original IDs for the nodes in partition 0.
    orig_nids_0 = dgl.data.load_tensors('/path/to/data/part0/orig_nids.dgl')
    # Get the original node IDs for node type 'user'
    user_orig_nids_0 = orig_nids_0['user']

    # Load the original IDs for the edges in partition 0.
    orig_eids_0 = dgl.data.load_tensors('/path/to/data/part0/orig_eids.dgl')
    # Get the original edge IDs for edge type 'like'
    like_orig_eids_0 = orig_nids_0['like']

During data dispatching, DGL assumes that the combined CPU RAM of the cluster
is able to hold the entire graph data. Node ownership is determined by the result
of partitioning algorithm where as for edges the owner of the destination node
also owns the edge as well.
