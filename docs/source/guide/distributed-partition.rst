7.4 Advanced Graph Partitioning
---------------------------------------

The chapter covers some of the advanced topics for graph partitioning.

METIS partition algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`METIS <http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis>`__ is a state-of-the-art
graph partitioning algorithm that can generate partitions with minimal number
of cross-partition edges, making it suitable for distributed message passing
where the amount of network communication is proportional to the number of
cross-partition edges. DGL has integrated METIS as the default partitioning
algorithm in its :func:`dgl.distributed.partition_graph` API.

Output format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regardless of the partitioning algorithm in use, the partitioned results are stored
in data files organized as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    data_root_dir/
      |-- graph_name.json       # partition configuration file in JSON
      |-- part0/                # data for partition 0
      |  |-- node_feats.dgl     # node features stored in binary format
      |  |-- edge_feats.dgl     # edge features stored in binary format
      |  |-- graph.dgl          # graph structure of this partition stored in binary format
      |
      |-- part1/                # data for partition 1
      |  |-- node_feats.dgl
      |  |-- edge_feats.dgl
      |  |-- graph.dgl
      |
      |-- ...                   # data for other partitions

When distributed to a cluster, the metadata JSON should be copied to all the machines
while the ``partX`` folders should be dispatched accordingly.

DGL provides a :func:`dgl.distributed.load_partition` function to load one partition
for inspection.

.. code:: python

  >>> import dgl
  >>> # load partition 0
  >>> part_data = dgl.distributed.load_partition('data_root_dir/graph_name.json', 0)
  >>> g, nfeat, efeat, partition_book, graph_name, ntypes, etypes = part_data  # unpack
  >>> print(g)
  Graph(num_nodes=966043, num_edges=34270118,
        ndata_schemes={'orig_id': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64),
                       'part_id': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64),
                       '_ID': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64),
                       'inner_node': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int32)}
        edata_schemes={'_ID': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64),
                       'inner_edge': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int8),
                       'orig_id': Scheme(shape=(), dtype=torch.int64)})

As mentioned in the `ID mapping`_ section, each partition carries auxiliary information
saved as ndata or edata such as original node/edge IDs, partition IDs, etc. Each partition
not only saves nodes/edges it owns, but also includes node/edges that are adjacent to
the partition (called **HALO** nodes/edges). The ``inner_node`` and ``inner_edge``
indicate whether a node/edge truely belongs to the partition (value is ``True``)
or is a HALO node/edge (value is ``False``).

The :func:`~dgl.distributed.load_partition` function loads all data at once. Users can
load features or the partition book using the :func:`dgl.distributed.load_partition_feats`
and :func:`dgl.distributed.load_partition_book` APIs respectively.


Parallel METIS partitioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For massive graphs where parallel preprocessing is desired, DGL supports
`ParMETIS <http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/overview>`__ as one
of the choices of partitioning algorithms.

.. note::

    Because ParMETIS does not support heterogeneous graph, users need to
    conduct ID conversion before and after running ParMETIS.
    Check out chapter :ref:`guide-distributed-hetero` for explanation.

.. note::

    Please make sure that the input graph to ParMETIS does not have
    duplicate edges (or parallel edges) and self-loop edges.

ParMETIS Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ParMETIS requires METIS and GKLib. Please follow the instructions `here
<https://github.com/KarypisLab/GKlib>`__ to compile and install GKLib. For
compiling and install METIS, please follow the instructions below to clone
METIS with GIT and compile it with int64 support.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/KarypisLab/METIS.git
    make config shared=1 cc=gcc prefix=~/local i64=1
    make install


For now, we need to compile and install ParMETIS manually. We clone the DGL branch of ParMETIS as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/KarypisLab/PM4GNN.git

Then compile and install ParMETIS.

.. code-block:: bash

    make config cc=mpicc prefix=~/local
    make install

Before running ParMETIS, we need to set two environment variables: ``PATH`` and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/local/bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/local/lib/

.. note::
    For massively large graphs, with number of nodes or edges is more than `2^{32} - 1`, 
    ParMETIS requires MPI version 4.0 or above.

Input format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    As a prerequisite, read chapter :doc:`guide-distributed-hetero` to understand
    how DGL organize heterogeneous graph for distributed training.

The input graph for ParMETIS is stored in three files with the following names:
``xxx_nodes.txt``, ``xxx_edges.txt`` and ``xxx_stats.txt``, 
where ``xxx`` is a graph name and other two file types are for 
storing nodes and edges.

Each row in any of the node files stores the information of a node. Row ID is
also the *homogeneous* ID of a node, e.g., row 0 is for node 0; row 1 is for
node 1, etc. Each row has the following format:

.. code-block:: none

    <node_type_id> <node_weight_list> <type_wise_node_id>

All fields are separated by whitespace:

* ``<node_type_id>`` is an integer starting from 0. Each node type is mapped to
  an integer. For a homogeneous graph, its value is always 0.
* ``<node_weight_list>`` are integers (separated by whitespace) that indicate
  the node weights used by ParMETIS to balance graph partitions. For homogeneous
  graphs, the list has only one integer while for heterogeneous graphs with
  :math:`T` node types, the list should has :math:`T` integers. If the node
  belongs to node type :math:`t`, then all the integers except the :math:`t^{th}`
  one are zero; the :math:`t^{th}` integer is the weight of that node. ParMETIS
  will try to balance the total node weight of each partition. For heterogeneous
  graph, it will try to distribute nodes of the same type to all partitions.
  The recommended node weights are 1 for balancing the number of nodes in each
  partition or node degrees for balancing the number of edges in each partition.
* ``<type_wise_node_id>`` is an integer representing the node ID in its own type.

Below shows an example of a node file for a heterogeneous graph with two node
types. Node type 0 has three nodes; node type 1 has four nodes. It uses two
node weights to ensure that ParMETIS will generate partitions with roughly the
same number of nodes for type 0 and the same number of nodes for type 1.

.. code-block:: none

    0 1 0 0
    0 1 0 1
    0 1 0 2
    1 0 1 0
    1 0 1 1
    1 0 1 2
    1 0 1 3

Similarly, each row in any of the  edge files stores the information of an edge. Row ID is
also the *homogeneous* ID of an edge, e.g., row 0 is for edge 0; row 1 is for
edge 1, etc. Each row has the following format:

.. code-block:: none

    <src_node_id> <dst_node_id> <type_wise_edge_id> <edge_type_id>

All fields are separated by whitespace:

* ``<src_node_id>`` is the *homogeneous* ID of the source node.
* ``<dst_node_id>`` is the *homogeneous* ID of the destination node.
* ``<type_wise_edge_id>`` is the edge ID for the edge type.
* ``<edge_type_id>`` is an integer starting from 0. Each edge type is mapped to
  an integer. For a homogeneous graph, its value is always 0.

``xxx_stats.txt`` stores some basic statistics of the graph. It has only one line with three fields
separated by whitespace:

.. code-block:: none

    <num_nodes> <num_edges> <total_node_weights>

* ``num_nodes`` stores the total number of nodes regardless of node types.
* ``num_edges`` stores the total number of edges regardless of edge types.
* ``total_node_weights`` stores the number of node weights in the node file.

Run ParMETIS and output format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ParMETIS contains a command called ``pm_dglpart``, which loads the graph stored
in the three files from the machine where ``pm_dglpart`` is invoked, distributes
data to all machines in the cluster and invokes ParMETIS to partition the
graph. When it completes, it generates three files for each partition:
``p<part_id>-xxx_nodes.txt``, ``p<part_id>-xxx_edges.txt``,
``p<part_id>-xxx_stats.txt``.

.. note::

    ParMETIS reassigns IDs to nodes during the partitioning. After ID reassignment,
    the nodes in a partition are assigned with contiguous IDs; furthermore, the nodes of
    the same type are assigned with contiguous IDs.

``p<part_id>-xxx_nodes.txt`` stores the node data of the partition. Each row represents
a node with the following fields:

.. code-block:: none

    <node_id> <node_type_id> <node_weight_list> <type_wise_node_id>

* ``<node_id>`` is the *homogeneous* node ID after ID reassignment.
* ``<node_type_id>`` is the node type ID.
* ``<node_weight_list>`` is the node weight used by ParMETIS (copied from the input file).
* ``<type_wise_node_id>`` is an integer representing the node ID in its own type.

``p<part_id>-xxx_edges.txt`` stores the edge data of the partition. Each row represents
an edge with the following fields:

.. code-block:: none

    <src_id> <dst_id> <orig_src_id> <orig_dst_id> <type_wise_edge_id> <edge_type_id>

* ``<src_id>`` is the *homogeneous* ID of the source node after ID reassignment.
* ``<dst_id>`` is the *homogeneous* ID of the destination node after ID reassignment.
* ``<orig_src_id>`` is the *homogeneous* ID of the source node in the input graph.
* ``<orig_dst_id>`` is the *homogeneous* ID of the destination node in the input graph.
* ``<type_wise_edge_id>`` is the edge ID in its own type.
* ``<edge_type_id>`` is the edge type ID.

When invoking ``pm_dglpart``, the three input files: ``xxx_nodes.txt``,
``xxx_edges.txt``, ``xxx_stats.txt`` should be located in the directory where
``pm_dglpart`` runs. The following command run four ParMETIS processes to
partition the graph named ``xxx`` into eight partitions (each process handles
two partitions).

.. code-block:: bash

    mpirun -np 4 pm_dglpart xxx 2

The output files from ParMETIS then need to be converted to the
:ref:`partition assignment format <guide-distributed-prep-partition>` to in
order to run subsequent preprocessing steps.
