def load_partition(part_config, part_id):
    ''' Load data of a partition from the data path.

    A partition data includes a graph structure of the partition, a dict of node tensors,
    a dict of edge tensors and some metadata. The partition may contain the HALO nodes,
    which are the nodes replicated from other partitions. However, the dict of node tensors
    only contains the node data that belongs to the local partition. Similarly, edge tensors
    only contains the edge data that belongs to the local partition. The metadata include
    the information of the global graph (not the local partition), which includes the number
    of nodes, the number of edges as well as the node assignment of the global graph.

    The function currently loads data through the local filesystem interface.

    part_config : str
        The path of the partition config file.

    ''' Partition a graph for distributed training and store the partitions on files.

    The partitioning occurs in three steps: 1) run a partition algorithm (e.g., Metis) to
    assign nodes to partitions; 2) construct partition graph structure based on
    the node assignment; 3) split the node features and edge features based on
    the partition result.

    When a graph is partitioned, each partition can contain *HALO* nodes, which are assigned
    to other partitions but are included in this partition for efficiency purpose.
    In this document, *local nodes/edges* refers to the nodes and edges that truly belong to
    a partition. The rest are "HALO nodes/edges".

    The partitioned data is stored into multiple files organized as follows:

    .. code-block:: none

        data_root_dir/
          |-- graph_name.json     # partition configuration file in JSON
          |-- node_map.npy        # partition id of each node stored in a numpy array (optional)
          |-- edge_map.npy        # partition id of each edge stored in a numpy array (optional)
          |-- part0/              # data for partition 0
              |-- node_feats.dgl  # node features stored in binary format
              |-- edge_feats.dgl  # edge features stored in binary format
              |-- graph.dgl       # graph structure of this partition stored in binary format
          |-- part1/              # data for partition 1
              |-- node_feats.dgl
              |-- edge_feats.dgl
              |-- graph.dgl

    First, the metadata of the original graph and the partitioning is stored in a JSON file
    named after ``graph_name``. This JSON file contains the information of the original graph
    as well as the path of the files that store each partition. Below show an example.

    .. code-block:: none

        {
           "graph_name" : "test",
           "part_method" : "metis",
           "num_parts" : 2,
           "halo_hops" : 1,
           "node_map": {
               "_U": [ [ 0, 1261310 ],
                       [ 1261310, 2449029 ] ]
           },
           "edge_map": {
               "_V": [ [ 0, 62539528 ],
                       [ 62539528, 123718280 ] ]
           },
           "etypes": { "_V": 0 },
           "ntypes": { "_U": 0 },
           "num_nodes" : 1000000,
           "num_edges" : 52000000,
           "part-0" : {
             "node_feats" : "data_root_dir/part0/node_feats.dgl",
             "edge_feats" : "data_root_dir/part0/edge_feats.dgl",
             "part_graph" : "data_root_dir/part0/graph.dgl",
           },
           "part-1" : {
             "node_feats" : "data_root_dir/part1/node_feats.dgl",
             "edge_feats" : "data_root_dir/part1/edge_feats.dgl",
             "part_graph" : "data_root_dir/part1/graph.dgl",
           },
        }

    Here are the definition of the fields in the partition configuration file:

    * ``graph_name`` is the name of the graph given by a user.
    * ``part_method`` is the method used to assign nodes to partitions.
      Currently, it supports "random" and "metis".
    * ``num_parts`` is the number of partitions.
    * ``halo_hops`` is the number of hops of nodes we include in a partition as HALO nodes.
    * ``node_map`` is the node assignment map, which tells the partition ID a node is assigned to.
      The format of ``node_map`` is described below.
    * ``edge_map`` is the edge assignment map, which tells the partition ID an edge is assigned to.
    * ``num_nodes`` is the number of nodes in the global graph.
    * ``num_edges`` is the number of edges in the global graph.
    * `part-*` stores the data of a partition.

    If ``reshuffle=False``, node IDs and edge IDs of a partition do not fall into contiguous
    ID ranges. In this case, DGL stores node/edge mappings (from
    node/edge IDs to partition IDs) in separate files (node_map.npy and edge_map.npy).
    The node/edge mappings are stored in numpy files.

    .. warning::
        this format is deprecated and will not be supported by the next release. In other words,
        the future release will always shuffle node IDs and edge IDs when partitioning a graph.

    If ``reshuffle=True``, ``node_map`` and ``edge_map`` contains the information
    for mapping between global node/edge IDs to partition-local node/edge IDs.
    For heterogeneous graphs, the information in ``node_map`` and ``edge_map`` can also be used
    to compute node types and edge types. The format of the data in ``node_map`` and ``edge_map``
    is as follows:

    .. code-block:: none

        {
            "node_type": [ [ part1_start, part1_end ],
                           [ part2_start, part2_end ],
                           ... ],
            ...
        },

    Essentially, ``node_map`` and ``edge_map`` are dictionaries. The keys are
    node/edge types. The values are lists of pairs containing the start and end of
    the ID range for the corresponding types in a partition.
    The length of the list is the number of
    partitions; each element in the list is a tuple that stores the start and the end of
    an ID range for a particular node/edge type in the partition.

    The graph structure of a partition is stored in a file with the DGLGraph format.
    Nodes in each partition is *relabeled* to always start with zero. We call the node
    ID in the original graph, *global ID*, while the relabeled ID in each partition,
    *local ID*. Each partition graph has an integer node data tensor stored under name
    `dgl.NID` and each value is the node's global ID. Similarly, edges are relabeled too
    and the mapping from local ID to global ID is stored as an integer edge data tensor
    under name `dgl.EID`. For a heterogeneous graph, the DGLGraph also contains a node
    data `dgl.NTYPE` for node type and an edge data `dgl.ETYPE` for the edge type.

    The partition graph contains additional node data ("inner_node" and "orig_id") and
    edge data ("inner_edge"):

    * "inner_node" indicates whether a node belongs to a partition.
    * "inner_edge" indicates whether an edge belongs to a partition.
    * "orig_id" exists when reshuffle=True. It indicates the original node IDs in the original
      graph before reshuffling.

    Node and edge features are splitted and stored together with each graph partition.
    All node/edge features in a partition are stored in a file with DGL format. The node/edge
    features are stored in dictionaries, in which the key is the node/edge data name and
    the value is a tensor. We do not store features of HALO nodes and edges.

    When performing Metis partitioning, we can put some constraint on the partitioning.
    Current, it supports two constrants to balance the partitioning. By default, Metis
    always tries to balance the number of nodes in each partition.

    * ``balance_ntypes`` balances the number of nodes of different types in each partition.
    * ``balance_edges`` balances the number of edges in each partition.

    To balance the node types, a user needs to pass a vector of N elements to indicate
    the type of each node. N is the number of nodes in the input graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    g : DGLGraph
        The input graph to partition
    graph_name : str
        The name of the graph. The name will be used to construct
        :py:meth:`~dgl.distributed.DistGraph`.
    num_parts : int
        The number of partitions
    out_path : str
        The path to store the files for all partitioned data.
    num_hops : int, optional
        The number of hops of HALO nodes we construct on a partition graph structure.
        The default value is 1.
    part_method : str, optional
        The partition method. It supports "random" and "metis". The default value is "metis".
    reshuffle : bool, optional
        Reshuffle nodes and edges so that nodes and edges in a partition are in
        contiguous ID range. The default value is True. The argument is deprecated
        and will be removed in the next release.
    balance_ntypes : tensor, optional
        Node type of each node. This is a 1D-array of integers. Its values indicates the node
        type of each node. This argument is used by Metis partition. When the argument is
        specified, the Metis algorithm will try to partition the input graph into partitions where
        each partition has roughly the same number of nodes for each node type. The default value
        is None, which means Metis partitions the graph to only balance the number of nodes.
    balance_edges : bool
        Indicate whether to balance the edges in each partition. This argument is used by
        the Metis algorithm.
