"""
Link Prediction using Graph Neural Networks
===========================================

In the :doc:`introduction <1_introduction>`, you have already learned
the basic workflow of using GNNs for node classification,
i.e. predicting the category of a node in a graph. This tutorial will
teach you how to train a GNN for link prediction, i.e. predicting the
existence of an edge between two arbitrary nodes in a graph.

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to

-  Build a GNN-based link prediction model.
-  Train and evaluate the model on a small DGL-provided dataset.

(Time estimate: 28 minutes)

# Overview of Link Prediction with GNN
# ------------------------------------
#
# Many applications such as social recommendation, item recommendation,
# knowledge graph completion, etc., can be formulated as link prediction,
# which predicts whether an edge exists between two particular nodes. This
# tutorial shows an example of predicting whether a citation relationship,
# either citing or being cited, between two papers exists in a citation
# network.
#
# This tutorial follows a relatively simple practice from
# `SEAL <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/53f0d7c537d99b3824f0f99d62ea2428-Paper.pdf>`__.
# It formulates the link prediction problem as a binary classification
# problem as follows:
#
# -  Treat the edges in the graph as *positive examples*.
# -  Sample a number of non-existent edges (i.e. node pairs with no edges
#    between them) as *negative* examples.
# -  Divide the positive examples and negative examples into a training
#    set and a test set.
# -  Evaluate the model with any binary classification metric such as Area
#    Under Curve (AUC).
#
# In some domains such as large-scale recommender systems or information
# retrieval, you may favor metrics that emphasize good performance of
# top-K predictions. In these cases you may want to consider other metrics
# such as mean average precision, and use other negative sampling methods,
# which are beyond the scope of this tutorial.
#
# Loading graph and features
# --------------------------
#
# Following the :doc:`introduction <1_introduction>`, this tutorial
# first loads the Cora dataset.
#

import dgl.data

dataset = dgl.data.CoraGraphDataset()
g = dataset[0]


######################################################################
# Prepare training and testing sets
# ---------------------------------
#
# This tutorial randomly picks 10% of the edges for positive examples in
# the test set, and leave the rest for the training set. It then samples
# the same number of edges for negative examples in both sets.
#

# Split edge set for training and testing
u, v = g.edges()

eids = np.arange(g.number_of_edges())
eids = np.random.permutation(eids)
test_size = int(len(eids) * 0.1)
train_size = g.number_of_edges() - test_size
test_pos_u, test_pos_v = u[eids[:test_size]], v[eids[:test_size]]
train_pos_u, train_pos_v = u[eids[test_size:]], v[eids[test_size:]]

# Find all negative edges and split them for training and testing
adj = sp.coo_matrix((np.ones(len(u)), (u.numpy(), v.numpy())))
adj_neg = 1 - adj.todense() - np.eye(g.number_of_nodes())
neg_u, neg_v = np.where(adj_neg != 0)

neg_eids = np.random.choice(len(neg_u), g.number_of_edges() // 2)
test_neg_u, test_neg_v = neg_u[neg_eids[:test_size]], neg_v[neg_eids[:test_size]]
train_neg_u, train_neg_v = neg_u[neg_eids[test_size:]], neg_v[neg_eids[test_size:]]


######################################################################
# When training, you will need to remove the edges in the test set from
# the original graph. You can do this via ``dgl.remove_edges``.
#
# .. note::
#
#    ``dgl.remove_edges`` works by creating a subgraph from the
#    original graph, resulting in a copy and therefore could be slow for
#    large graphs. If so, you could save the training and test graph to
#    disk, as you would do for preprocessing.

# Define a GraphSAGE model
# ------------------------
#
# This tutorial builds a model consisting of two
# `GraphSAGE <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216>`__ layers, each computes
# new node representations by averaging neighbor information. DGL provides
# ``dgl.nn.SAGEConv`` that conveniently creates a GraphSAGE layer.
#

from dgl.nn import SAGEConv

# build a two-layer GraphSAGE model
class GraphSAGE(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_feats, h_feats):
        super(GraphSAGE, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = SAGEConv(in_feats, h_feats, 'mean')
        self.conv2 = SAGEConv(h_feats, h_feats, 'mean')
    
    def forward(self, g, in_feat):
        h = self.conv1(g, in_feat)
        h = F.relu(h)
        h = self.conv2(g, h)
        return h

# The model then predicts the probability of existence of an edge by
# computing a score between the representations of both incident nodes
# with a function (e.g. an MLP or a dot product), which you will see in

# Positive graph, negative graph, and ``apply_edges``
# ---------------------------------------------------
#
# In previous tutorials you have learned how to compute node
# representations with a GNN. However, link prediction requires you to
# compute representation of *pairs of nodes*.
#
# DGL recommends you to treat the pairs of nodes as another graph, since
# you can describe a pair of nodes with an edge. In link prediction, you
# will have a *positive graph* consisting of all the positive examples as
# edges, and a *negative graph* consisting of all the negative examples.
# The *positive graph* and the *negative graph* will contain the same set
# of nodes as the original graph.  This makes it easier to pass node
# features among multiple graphs for computation.  As you will see later,
# you can directly fed the node representations computed on the entire
# graph to the positive and the negative graphs for computing pair-wise
# scores.
#
# The following code constructs the positive graph and the negative graph
# for the training set and the test set respectively.
#

train_pos_g = dgl.graph((train_pos_u, train_pos_v), num_nodes=g.number_of_nodes())

test_neg_g = dgl.graph((test_neg_u, test_neg_v), num_nodes=g.number_of_nodes())


######################################################################
# The benefit of treating the pairs of nodes as a graph is that you can
# use the ``DGLGraph.apply_edges`` method, which conveniently computes new
# edge features based on the incident nodes’ features and the original
# edge features (if applicable).
#
# DGL provides a set of optimized builtin functions to compute new
# edge features based on the original node/edge features. For example,
# ``dgl.function.u_dot_v`` computes a dot product of the incident nodes’
# representations for each edge.
